# dynamic-message-passing
Dynamic message passing for Independent Cascades (IC) in Julia.
Algorithm allows to:
- calculate marginals for a given IC model
- infer IC parameters based on a sample of cascades

It is exact on trees and a good aproximation for sparse networks and/or low regime of activation probabilities.
